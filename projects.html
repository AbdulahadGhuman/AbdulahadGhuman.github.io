            <h3 id = "PurposeIP"> Purpose: The purpose of my senior project was to create an IP banning system. Essentially, the user would first go through a Captcha block. Afterwards, there was a machine learning based algorithm that would determine if it's a bot. (We did not complete this part and there are flaws). Then the user would have to wait for an admin decision, in the case that the admin did not allow the address, he was permanently banned, otherwise, the admin would make a decision each time.  </h3>
            <h3 id = "NoteIP"> Note: Since this was my senior project, the work was split, I will only take credit for what I did. I did not create the database, I did not write the Python file, I only altered it to use flask, nor did I create any of the ML files, I simply implemented them to JavaScript. I also designed all of the webpages with some slight assistance, I did not make it responsive yet.  </h3>
